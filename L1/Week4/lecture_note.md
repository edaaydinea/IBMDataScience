    - Tables can be linked based on common data fields, enabling complex data retrieval and relationship mapping.
- **Key Components**:
    - **Tables**: Contain records (rows) and attributes (columns).
    - **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
    - **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.
- **Example**:
    - **Customer Table**: Contains data about customers, with attributes like Company ID, Company Name, etc.
    - **Transaction Table**: Contains data about transactions, with attributes like Transaction Date, Customer ID, etc.
    - The Customer ID field links the customer and transaction tables, allowing for queries across both.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**:
    - The standard language for querying and managing relational databases.
    - Allows for efficient data retrieval, insertion, update, and deletion.
- **Features and Advantages**:
    - **Data Integrity**: Restricts fields to specific data types and values, reducing irregularities.
    - **Data Redundancy**: Minimizes duplicate data, e.g., customer information stored once and linked via foreign keys.
    - **Security**: Offers controlled access and data governance.
    - **Flexibility**: Allows changes to schema (e.g., adding columns) without downtime.
    - **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data accuracy and consistency through Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
    - **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Easy export/import options and cloud-based mirroring for minimal data loss.
- **Types of RDBMS**:
    - **On-Premises**: Systems like IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL.
    - **Cloud-Based (Database-as-a-Service)**: Examples include Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, IBM DB2 on Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and SQL Azure.
- **Use Cases**:
    - **Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)**: Supports high transaction rates, frequent queries, and fast response times.
    - **Data Warehouses**: Optimized for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) for business intelligence and historical data analysis.
    - **IoT Solutions**: Handles data collection and processing from edge devices.
- **Limitations**:
    - Not well-suited for semi-structured and unstructured data.
    - Requires identical schemas and data types for migration between systems.
    - Has field length limitations, restricting the amount of information stored in each field.
- **Conclusion**:
    - Despite limitations, relational databases remain a predominant technology for structured data management, providing robust, reliable, and efficient data handling capabilities.
